# FirefightingControls

This is a mod for the game RimWorld by Ludeon Studios.

The mod provides a button to dynamically change the Area used for Firefighting, to something other than Home area.

# Introduction

The mod provides a button to dynamically change the Area used for Firefighting, to something other than Home area.

The dependency "ModButtons" will put a button tray in the lower-right corner, and inside that, you'll find a new button, to change the Firefighting area.

No longer is Firefighting always the "Home" area. You can set it to "Area2" or "Unrestricted" or even the "Build Roofs" area!

Pawns will then only fight fires in that area, instead of Home area.

If you set the firefighting area to "Unrestricted", pawns will fight fires anywhere on the map.

Note this does NOT (yet) update the default "Fire!" alert, which still only alerts for Home area.
